so first of all we have brought you to the destination for a nice early morning breakfast very delicious sindhi dal pakwan is available at the breakfast centre here so let us taste it and introduce you to them
hello hello bhaiya what is your name sir my name is vijay and since when have you been serving this bhaag my father started it it is going to be completely homely tasted yes of course if someone asks us no friend we do not want to eat outside but we say no this is our home made by our hands so in a way it is home made food okay okay and all our things are absolutely fresh it has been almost 25 years what is your timing sir it is from 8 am to 11 am what things are you making sir we have dal pakwan which is the best among our sindhis you must have heard that sindhis like dal pakwan very much absolutely and our kudi chola chola bhatura rice okay you are making these threefour things early in the morning and what is the pricing sir our everyone has a plate of 40
oh this thing these are the dishes ours is matthi type it is clay type this is called a pakwan it is made of flour okay we put dal on it what kind of dal is it it should be pure moong dal okay and to make it a little spicy we also add chickpeas to it okay usually dal is acceptable but we have chole with a little tadka and on top of this we put onions
okay this is tamarind chutney which will enhance its taste it will make it a little sweet and sour and what is this these are chilli tipres sir okay chilli tipres tapori wow i mean this is famous in rajasthan is not it yes yes it is ready yes it is ready wow brother wow i did not find such dal pakwan in jaipur there is a small shop anywhere
but it tastes very good dal pakwan in it is eaten the most by sindhis so this is the first experience for me i will keep some dal and tapres of chilli basically this is my attempt
let me show you the same thing which i have already tried i had already tried it brother if we talk about the taste it tastes amazing because the dal is very bold the chole is mildly spicy and it gives that crunchy touch with the chillies so it is a great combination you must have seen these tikkas so we are roaming in jaipur we have brought you to a nice place in jaipur i have brought you to raja park near radheshyam ji radheshyam jis paneer tikka is very famous namaskar ji namaskar ji what is your name sir my gulshan bhatia sir our father had started paneer in jaipur so

there are small lanes squares shops on the roads palaces and gatherings this is the heart of rajasthanis it is an officer city it is a beautiful city many days are spent here this is jaipur
jaipur is one of the largest cities of rajasthan which is famous for its forces palaces and museums i do nt want to do something different by doing everything normal so in this video we will show you some off things that you can do in jaipur
in this video we will show you the detailed morning and night of jaipur side and amer side so that you do not face any problem while roaming around good morning yes we are going to see the sunrise ahead which is an off experience if you see this from where from the jal mahal then it has not yet come to the saints but very beautiful colours have come for now i had the advantage that it is exactly opposite to our hotel this is the general time so it is 645 and these colours are visible let us go now and show you the sunrise sita is looking beautiful we thought it was stunning san would not be visible and we went there
then he is showing us from his room to see this place
6 minutes now we have come to shri jagat shiromani temple which is situated in amer and it is dedicated to three hindu deities which are meerabai and krishna ji and krishna ji this temple remains open from sunrise till sunset if you want to do videography here with proper setup 25
in memory whose name was jagat singh
because this is a destination place so there is very less crowd here because very few people know about it so you can admire its beauty to your hearts content and you can also click a lot of pictures here because there will be no crowd behind
the temple has a lot of significance in the local history of amer it is said that the statue of krishna ji which is inside this temple was worshipped by meerabai in the state of mewar so this temple is ahead of amer fort and much further ahead in the streets people had taken a rickshaw which is like an unhealthy choice because if you take uber or some other people they will show you the intercity charges because we are in jaipur and this is in amer so they show very high charges and we had taken this rickshaw from jal mahal and there are a lot of people standing there so it will take you 1520 minutes to reach here there are a total of 2012 step wells in india out of which 100 are in rajasthan and now we have come to panna minakund which is in amer this step well is the most restored and operational in rajasthan and it has water all year round there used to be water supply for the locals nearby so in the months when there was less rainfall the locals used to take water from it and see what a beautiful cemetery it is it has 13 storeys of steps in which there are 3500 steps so the form of the mazes and its depth is more than 100 feet in fact it is a well in the world of 40 minutes you can also take a guide tour the price of which is quite reasonable sangeet so you can also go here and take photos in rajasthani outfits it is 5 minutes away so you can combine both of them and see them together
sangeet hey bhaiya i just took you to show the pond and the temple in the entire palace and these sit right next to the jal mahal i will write priyankas number in the description box thank you bhaiya
sangeet you can also see the palace and the water is very beautiful and there are a lot of shops around here in fact you can also get your photos clicked here wearing rajasthani costumes no bhaiya if you do not want to ride the camera it means you do not need such photos we will take them on the phone just the clothes rehan you are confused which phone will come sangeet sangeet we will make some videos sangeet sangeet sangeet it is 10 minutes away sangeet sangeet sangeet the rajput dynasty kachwaha used to rule over the kshatriyas of gayatri here this is a royal cremation ground in which their all the kings and maharajas were cremated except maharaja sawai singh who was cremated in the grounds of jaipur city palace
there are hardly any tourists here and even if there are they are mostly foreigners
the beautiful marble work adds to the beauty of this place and it is so peaceful here that you can sit and meditate here
there is no signboard here so if you want to get more information about the place you can also take a guide
now we are going to the sun temple which you will see at the top
there is a little climb here
on one side we have come by auto and the rest we have to walk
so there are two ways to go
so in this you can go to the sun temple directly or by taking toll or by taking tax
master from here see the view of the sun temple for rs
250
what a nice view of the whole of jaipur is visible from here
it is also called sunset point
from here you can see the whole city
walk a little towards the sun temple
when you are coming up this climb be careful of the monkeys
there is also a temple of hanuman ji there
there are a lot of monkeys the climb is not much it is a 10minute climb
prasha prasha this place is full of monkeys you will see all the families who keep on eating all the time but still be alert be careful take care of your things especially your mobile if you do not let it bother you this temple is very beautiful and betting in the water here is considered to be a species especially on mahashivratri when a lot of people come here galta kund is the deepest pool on these important festivals you will find lots of people here jumping into the pool to take a bath
aarti is being performed here when you come forward there is a temple of shri gyan gopal ji right there within the same compound and there is an exit from here where you can take an auto till here if you do not want to climb up we have put it in front of the suraj temple
so you can book from them here whenever you come to jaipur we will also take you to gaya and show you the america thank you bhaiya
praise nahargarh 10 kilometers away from aamir food is very spectacular because the sunset looks very beautiful from here
if you come by uber then they will charge more here
you can take your own car to come inside you can park it but you can also take a round trip because it is difficult to get anything from here
excuse me you can do the light and sound was very amazing i mean their voices are so amazing that you will get goosebumps
seriously amitabh bachchan is the narrator in it but we felt that by playing a prank the person who gave the voice of prabhas in bahubali he has also done very significant roles
the dhruv is out and we would suggest that if you ever want to go inside aamir fort then before that you should watch the light and sound show you will enjoy it more and it is a must do it
right now it is 720 in the morning and we have come to smriti van which opens at 600 in the morning and it is getting very cold right now
smoke is coming out of the mouth as well and this is smriti van as the name suggests it is a memorial park and basically this park has been built in the memory of our soldiers who died in kargil
so let us go and see it
here two wheeler and car parking are both provided
you cannot park in some spaces
the good thing is that boards are put up everywhere so that there is no regret
as this is a very big place maps are also made here so you can go after seeing them
it is absolutely natural here it is so beautiful and empty right now
and as you can hear the sound of birds you will see birds threefour peacocks are sitting on the tree they are enjoying the sunrise from there
along with this information about some plants is also written here
i have said that there can be three balls here so you have to walk according to the way you know otherwise any animal can also attack you
in any situation if you see a leopard then you have to remember that you cannot run faster than your companions
praise
praise it feels very good just tell me your name whatever you feel here this nature is so beautiful you can say anything i have felt so good after coming to pune maharashtra i get a feeling of natural forest in it and i am feeling very good so we felt very good this morning start means our day has started so well an environment it will be good when we go maybe then we will know
so now we are in hawa mahal
and here you are very surprised hawa mahal festival show is happening lightings are happening on top of hawa mahal they are playing it with different and fireworks are also happening it is a big festival and the whole road is closed so we will show you some glimpses and along with that a lot of ians have come so maybe mostly it seems to be a festival of ians but this festival happens on sankranti and this is the true celebration of culture here you will see street food performance puppet and dance shows and more go on all night long

jaipur is a beautiful city however, more than it's beauty, it's known for its food in today's video, i'll introduce you to some of the best foods from jaipur one of the best things is that the street food here is primarily vegetarian.
so for mihir and me it's a perfect place to come and eat street food because we are both vegetarians.
in fact he's jain so he doesn't even eat potato!
this is actually a curated experience by airbnb i'm trying out an airbnb experience for the first time, let's see how this goes!
our food walk started form the iconic raj mandir theatre
so this is jaipur's famous  pyaaz (onion) kachori mihir is already eating it and i'm going to try it now it's really crispy
and i love the chatni i really love the sweet chatni so will add that as well we eating the kachori at narsingh on the mirza ismail road or mi road so our next destination is ram namkeen bhandar and we'll try a unique specialty from jaipur here this is mirchi vada and what's different about it is that it's eaten with kadhi it was started in 1970
so it's quite an old place because of the addition of kadhi, the taste is a bit tangy which is what i think is very different and unique about it very nice mirchi vada
it's a lot of fun walking around on the streets as we can see jaipur nicely i hope we are eating something sweet as well
so next we are going to drink some lassi it'll cool us down in the heat here
and we'll get something sweet also as promised, next we are doing lassi.
but before that look at that light behind me.
so gorgeous!
with this beautiful light we are going to the oldest lassi shop here called lassiwala.
it's here since 1944.
hopefully it'll kind of soothe us and also cool us down!
time to try out the lassi now!
we are only drinking half glass as it looks quite heavy and big really reminds me of the kind of lassi we used to drink at home when we were kids another thing to keep in mind is that there are many shops with the same name so you have to look out for the shop that says 'since 1944' that is the oldest one and the original source
yeah!
that's my pro tip for today!
now in case you are wondering why this road is called mirza ismail road he was actually the architect for this whole neighbourhood
and that's why this is called mirza ismail road the architect of jaipur was another man bhattacharya, but this area is famous for mirza ismail
so what you see right behind me is called sanganeri gate because this road comes from sanganer which is where hand block-printing is done.
of course, we aren't seeing all the gates today, but we are going to touch a little bit of old jaipur tonight
so i've just randomly walked into one of the saree shops here called 'shipra sarees' it's a beautiful, colourful shop "which sarees is most famous here?"
"we have the traditional bandhej."
"i know one saree called laharia saree - do you have that as well?"
so for absolutely no good reason we came there to see sarees and now mihir and i are selecting shirts for us!
but this looks so nice!
i love it!
we purchased these shirts without any negotiations and everyone's is telling us that the price is good!
(rs 350/ shirt) for chai we've come again to an old historical, old-school jaipur shop it's called 'sahu restaurant' it was established in 1968 and has been here since then the chai here is delicious
and we'll try that
next
i was just told that they have a masala with a secret recipe since 1968 even today chai is made with which gives it an old flavour and we get good chai which we can't get anywhere else please give one chai in a kulhad (earthen cup)
my plan was to try only a little chai
but i got the whole kulhad
but...chai is love!
hmmm...
chai is so good!
next we are going to jaipur's famous 'namkeen gali' so jaipur is quite famous for it's wide variety of namkeen (kind of savoury snack) one of which is called 'sev' and we'll try that
ow
we are in a shop called 'up namkeen' this is a 55 years old nameen shop but it's name is up
so it's from my part of the world as we walked around in the market, we heard garba (dance) music and we then spent some time enjoying that as well even before we start our dinner today, we've come to eat dessert we've come to gc dairy this is a dessert place where you get tasty indian desserts this is saffron-pistachio butter and we make it with hands we get pure white butter using the same recipe that's followed in villages and then we add saffron, pistachio, and cardamom so this is saffron-pistachio butter unfortunately, we couldn't go to samrat that evening and that's why we reached there the next morning good morning from jaipur!
we are starting our day from an iconic food place here called 'samrat' and at 7am we'll have chai and breakfast of kachori and samosa if you go to jaipur, you absolutely have to visit lmb also both their sweets and food are quite tasty as per the menu card here it says - traditional halwai since 1727
it was initially a sweets shop and the sweets here are very famous i've also come here twice before and ate only sweets
but i see this place as a proper restaurant so we'll eat food and also lots of sweets as both mihir and i love sweets so the plan is to gain 10 kgs and then burn is all by walking around i'm not sure if this is the right way of eating this
but i've seen people fill chutney inside the kachori you always get green chutney but not the sweet one good thing is that they have sweet chutney here today
chutney filled kachori so good!
this is pyaaz (onion) kachori and also has daal (lentils) in it and this is something everyone eats all the time for breakfast....
so...very jaipuri breakfast!
later my friend rj took me to another iconic chai place in jaipur my friend is very particular about chai and we rode half an hour to reach here we are driving chai at 'gulab ji chai wale' because chai here is great and my friend's favourite!
we earlier had chai at sahu but rj isn't a fan of that place so he got me here because this is better so let's next try gulab chai for dinner we've come to another rj recommended place we've come to mahavir rabdi bhandar not just rabdi, we'll get bejad ki roti, aalo-pyaaz-paneer subzi and garlic chutney, and buttermilk and later we can also eat their famous layer rabdi (indian dessert) there are many shops by the same name, and the original one is the last shop on the right in the lane we have anmol here and he's the owner of the shop my friend got name here to eat bejad ki roti
and i don't even know what that it
it's made with three grains
but i also don't know more sorghum, wheat and chickpea
so this is bejad ki roti and we are eating this with a spicy vegetable one is a gatta subzi and the other one is pyaar-paneer-aalo subzi  
i love the roti
but it's size is huge!
a family of four would eat it, and i'm eating it alone for dessert we've come to another famous shop called 'bhagat sweets shop' we came here to eat milk laddoos but they are finished already so will we eat nothing?
oh...they are saying hello to me!
so what should we eat if you don't have milk laddoos?
the milk laddoos are famous here and i'm eating this for the first time "would you recommend eating rasmalai here?"
"no. only try the milk laddoos!"
tomorrow morning we'll come again, pick the laddoos and try them!
i hope you enjoyed today's food video!

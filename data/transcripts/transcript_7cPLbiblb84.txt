to explore various tourist points in jaipur you can hire taxi, autos and bikes you can also take electric autos and public transport like bus, metros which are quite cheap.
as i traveled solo to explore jaipur
so i hired an auto which cost me for inr 1500 per day.
on day 1, you can explore albert hall museum friends-for most of tourist attractions, one need to buy ticket.
so my recommendation is to buy a composite ticket which costs inr 400 for indians and inr 1000 for foreigners.
this ticket is valid for 2 days.
in which you can visit 7 to 8 points.
so that you don't need to buy tickets at every point and hence can save your time.

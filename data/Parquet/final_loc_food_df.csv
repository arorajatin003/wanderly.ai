hawa mahal,hawa mahal,Yatra Mitra,7cPLbiblb84,0,"dgeted hotel in jaipur then my recommendation is hotel aroma classic
which is hardly 2 km away from hawa mahal
for this budgeted hotel i had to pay inr 2000 per day
ambience of the hotel was good and room was spacious
service of the hotel was also very good
2 to 3 days are enough to visit jaipur and the best season to visit here is in winter
to explore various tourist points in jaipur you can hire taxi autos and bikes you can also take electric autos and public transport like bus metros which are quite cheap
as i traveled solo to explore jaipur
so i hired an auto which cost me for inr 1500 per day
on day 1 you can explore albert hall museum friendsfor most of tourist attractions one need to buy ticket
so my recommendation is to buy a composite ticket which costs inr 400 for indians and inr 1000 for foreigners
this ticket is valid for 2 days
in which you can visit 7 to 8 points
so that you do not need to buy tickets at every point and hence can save your time
albert hall museum is the oldest museum of jaipur
building was designed by samuel jacob
and in 1887 it was opened for public visit
this museum is named after king albert edward vii
in this museum you can see these beautiful paintings on the walls pottery objects sculptures stone work woodwork jewelry carpets and can see precious artifacts from all over the world
the museum is a true representation of indosaracenic style of architecture and design
surprisingly this museum also has a 2400yearold egyptian mummy
whose name used to be tutu
each part of the museum gives a different glimpse of a time
when we did not have the machines to carve such a huge structure
beautiful artifacts paintings and designs of this museum is a treat for the gazing eyes
this museum looks even more beautiful in the night
which you can also visit between 7 pm to 10 pm in the night
just 1 km away from albert hall museum you can explore sargasuli tower
it is entry is from back road it is also known as isarlat sargasuli
people call it as tower of heaven
it was built in 1749 by raja ishwari singh after his victory over raja madhav singh
this sevenstoried tower is known for its circular steps
there is a door on each floor that opens to a balcony
there are 264 steps in total
from the top of the tower visitors can enjoy a 360degree panoramic view of jaipur city
this skykissing tower is a symbol of jaipurs victory
a symbol of pride and glory because of its height beauty and glorious history this building fills the people of jaipur with inspiration and pride
and this tower looks amazing when seen at night
just one minute away from sargasuli tower you can visit hawa mahal
the most recognisable landmark in jaipur is hawa mahal
also known as palace of winds
the entry of the hawa mahal is from the side road
timings are 9 am to 530 pm and tickets are as per screen hawa mahal was built by maharaja sawai pratap singh in 1799
which was designed by ustad lalchand
it is made up of red and pink sandstone
do you know hawa mahal is the tallest building in the world
which is built without any foundation
and people from all over the world like to click their photos in front of it
the design of hawa mahal is a perfect blend of islamic mughal architecture with hindu rajput architecture
this palace is made in the shape of a crown
some people also compare this form with the crown of lord shri krishna
because maharaja sawai pratap singh was a great devotee of lord shri krishna
the hawa mahal has a temple on each of its five floors
sharad temple on the first floor ratan temple on the second then the vichitra temple prakash temple and hawa temple
the hawa mahal has a total of 953 windows
and you will be surprised to know that there are no stairs in this fivestorey building
ramps have been made here because it was easy to carry the palanquin of rajput royal women from the ramp
in those days purdah system was strictly followed and royal rajput women were not allowed to show their face to strangers that is why maharaja built the hawa mahal
so that these royal women could see daytoday activities of the street and festivals through these windows without coming in front of anyone
friends believe it or not the beautiful view of hawa mahal is visible only from its outside
you can also cross the road and visit cafes and restaurants in front of the hawa mahal you can reach on the terrace and can see the hawa mahal
clicks of hawa mahal from here are very awesome
you will find a lot of food shops on the main road of hawa mahal
and you can also do shopping from here
the more beautiful the hawa mahal looks during the day the more it looks dazzling at night so you must visit it at night too
after hawa mahal you can visit jantarmantar
which is located at a walking distance of half kilometer
the ticket here is inr 50 and the entry timing is 9 am to 5 pm
this jantarmantar is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments
which was built by raja sawai jay singh in 1734
this jantar mantar also comes in the unesco world heritage site
there are five such jantar mantars in india which are located in delhi varanasi ujjain mathura and jaipur
but the special thing about jaipurs jantarmantar is that it is an outdoor observatory where all the instruments are in open space instead of an enclosed building or room
it is a stone observatory
metal shrinks and expands according to the season
and any climate does not impacts the stone
with the help of these instruments events like weather local time planets constellations and eclipses can be detected
as an example this instrument is the worlds largest sun clock
which calculates time up to an accuracy of two seconds
similarly you can find here more interesting different instruments
so if you are an astronomy or a science student then this is a must visit place because it is the only observatory where you can do practical calculations according to the sun
and even today it is in working condition and shows results exactly
that is why it is called jantarmantar
because jantar means yantra which means instrument and mantar means calculation so jantarmantar means calculation instrument
friendsi will recommend if you want to understand all these instruments
well then you must hire a guide here to help you understand better
and here is an audio visual hall where detailed information is provided about jantarmantra which is free of cost
tipvisit jantar mantar in the afternoon time because then the sun is vertically above us so that you can understand the instrument interpretation better
exactly in front of jantar mantar is the city palace whose ticket is inr 200
city palace was also built by maharaja sawai jai singh in 1727
this palace is a beautiful fusion of earlier mughal and rajput architecture where even today the ruling royal family lives in its private section
palace has mubarak mahal also known as the palace of reception
mubarak mahal has now been converted into a museum
where you can find royal costumes like pashmina shawls banaras silk sarees clothes of maharaja sawai madho singh and 15th century rajput weapons are also on display
city palace has diwaneaam known as sarvato bhadra it is that place where the maharaja used to hold public meetings
then comes the deewanekhas this is the royal court where where the maharaja used to hold private meetings with his court
the ceiling of the palace is decorated with beautiful paintings
here you can see two silver ganga jali with a capacity of 4000 liters whose place is in the guinness book of world records
it is said to have been used by maharaja sawai madho singh to carry holy water from the ganges during his visit to england
because he only used to drink ganga water
you can also hire a guide in the city palace and it will take you 2 hours comfortably to visit the entire palace
whatever you say you will definitely be mesmerized by the beauty of city palace
whether i should write jaipur as my life or indias pride i should write the name of jaipur youth of dreams there is a lot to write but my heart said this i should write the story of the sacrifices of the heroes the respect of the lions
you can visit last spot of day 1 ie ramnivasgarden
which is located near albert hall museum ticket is inr 10 and timings are 9 am to 5 pm
the garden was built by maharaja sawai ram singh in 1868
which has been renovated from time to time
you can take a peaceful walk in this beautiful garden
this garden was very clean
but at some places i saw plastic wrappers which were not visible from far but were visible near the plants then i thought let us give back something to this beautiful garden
and in the meantime the local people also helped me in cleaning the garden
and we all started cleaning up the trash here

but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences

but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes
all you can enjoy i recommend will do their cheese green chili for every order along with this there is also a papad platter from which to eat the fun increases further to eat full miles here the price may be higher but a fort it is an experience to come inside in glory and you can take royal experience that is jai mahal palace i stayed in this palace was and that experience i share with you before i have done it if you have not seen it after the video is over they must watch this there are two restaurants in the palace hai jordan hose is an authentic italian restaurant is here pizza pasta risot as you get all the italian dishes the atmosphere is very beautiful of pool and palace enjoy eating comfortably with the view something else but many people in jaipur only traditional rajasthani culture jaymahal wants to experience them palaces cinemation is not all in this hotel pierce glasses spoon plates are all gold its atmosphere with them is also great large archus energy long tables colorful windows look so royal and there are some private dining areas here where you eat comfortably sitting on donkeys down can enjoy before your order papad platter comes and here is their vegetarian plate in different dishes in it meet
and so many local specialty such as dal bati churma ker sangri yeh there is a very cool trio experience is probably the most spectacular will experience in hotels in jaipur and that is its names in suvarna mahal restaurant it is everywhere from carpet to sealing but golden feel is all the golden feel there is also a layer of 18 carat gold on utensils here you can try their vegetarian plate in it all items are served in a very royal style and the style of serving their taste and this is complete the royal atmosphere and their wonderful sake because of this it seems exactly the rambagh there is another restaurant in steam this one the old train is like a coach and there is also a restore steam engine really here you have many different types of different types continental dishes that you relax both of them can enjoy sitting with restaurants are part of rambagh palace but also open for outside visitors rambagh palace remains the most of india one of expensive hotels and i have experienced luxurious stay and recently i have also shared her link with you if below is given in the description box you are planning a luxury trip in jaipur if you are rambagh palace or jai mahal palace surely keep in mind
yes on them night charges can be between 30 and 60000 so they must keep in mind but both of them there are also 200 years old palace where one rajput family and ministers really in the era used to live because of that you have a restless place i get experience of living in rooms is another such luxury property trident jaipur this water palace right in front of and in many rooms here mansarovar lake and beautiful view of jal mahal palace appears it is a little different from those palaces and in this you have a little modern style eye if you enjoy the pool buffet plate here can but if you are right in a different way if you book on time you also in 78000 you can find living in this luxury property apart from these luxury hotels many here separate hotels are the price of mid range hotels 4 from 8000 from the fun lemon tree you will find a hotel like abis here if you book in advance then just 34000 i can also talk
but yes the season on time this price increases the season ie here in these months between november to march very pleasant weather remains light sunlight in the morning and in the evening cold air for such a trip cotton clothes are right
but at night you shawl or jacket is needed jaipur is the capital of rajasthan and india one of the most famous cities of is here but the tourist arrival is also very much and that it is very easy to reach here due to india direct flights come here from many cities delhi to jaipur is close â‚¹ 2500000 if you book in advance you such prices can be available for one and a half hours how many miles cross
but if you have time then you train you can save some money from mumbai many such trains from jaipur delhi to jaipur will be found and at â‚¹ 600 according to the coach the seat starts and 1617 it takes this hour to delhi jaipur famous of india and india is also associated with tourist circuit also in golden triangle if you are included from delhi or agra to road you can easily come here for this buses and private taxis are also available which leaves you jaipur in 2 3000 la is the best to come to jaipur and you and if there is short distance then you also from erickshaw it can go in sharing and just you take a seat at 40 you sometimes can also do bargain

albert hall,albert hall,SugarSpiceNice Hindi,7cPLbiblb84,0,"lo to explore jaipur
so i hired an auto which cost me for inr 1500 per day
on day 1 you can explore albert hall museum friendsfor most of tourist attractions one need to buy ticket
so my recommendation is to buy a composite ticket which costs inr 400 for indians and inr 1000 for foreigners
this ticket is valid for 2 days
in which you can visit 7 to 8 points
so that you do not need to buy tickets at every point and hence can save your time
albert hall museum is the oldest museum of jaipur
building was designed by samuel jacob
and in 1887 it was opened for public visit
this museum is named after king albert edward vii
in this museum you can see these beautiful paintings on the walls pottery objects sculptures stone work woodwork jewelry carpets and can see precious artifacts from all over the world
the museum is a true representation of indosaracenic style of architecture and design
surprisingly this museum also has a 2400yearold egyptian mummy
whose name used to be tutu
each part of the museum gives a different glimpse of a time
when we did not have the machines to carve such a huge structure
beautiful artifacts paintings and designs of this museum is a treat for the gazing eyes
this museum looks even more beautiful in the night
which you can also visit between 7 pm to 10 pm in the night
just 1 km away from albert hall museum you can explore sargasuli tower
it is entry is from back road it is also known as isarlat sargasuli
people call it as tower of heaven
it was built in 1749 by raja ishwari singh after his victory over raja madhav singh
this sevenstoried tower is known for its circular steps
there is a door on each floor that opens to a balcony
there are 264 steps in total
from the top of the tower visitors can enjoy a 360degree panoramic view of jaipur city
this skykissing tower is a symbol of jaipurs victory
a symbol of pride and glory because of its height beauty and glorious history this building fills the people of jaipur with inspiration and pride
and this tower looks amazing when seen at night
just one minute away from sargasuli tower you can visit hawa mahal
the most recognisable landmark in jaipur is hawa mahal
also known as palace of winds
the entry of the hawa mahal is from the side road
timings are 9 am to 530 pm and tickets are as per screen hawa mahal was built by maharaja sawai pratap singh in 1799
which was designed by ustad lalchand
it is made up of red and pink sandstone
do you know hawa mahal is the tallest building in the world
which is built without any foundation
and people from all over the world like to click their photos in front of it
the design of hawa mahal is a perfect blend of islamic mughal architecture with hindu rajput architecture
this palace is made in the shape of a crown
some people also compare this form with the crown of lord shri krishna
because maharaja sawai pratap singh was a great devotee of lord shri krishna
the hawa mahal has a temple on each of its five floors
sharad temple on the first floor ratan temple on the second then the vichitra temple prakash temple and hawa temple
the hawa mahal has a total of 953 windows
and you will be surprised to know that there are no stairs in this fivestorey building
ramps have been made here because it was easy to carry the palanquin of rajput royal women from the ramp
in those days purdah system was strictly followed and royal rajput women were not allowed to show their face to strangers that is why maharaja built the hawa mahal
so that these royal women could see daytoday activities of the street and festivals through these windows without coming in front of anyone
friends believe it or not the beautiful view of hawa mahal is visible only from its outside
you can also cross the road and visit cafes and restaurants in front of the hawa mahal you can reach on the terrace and can see the hawa mahal
clicks of hawa mahal from here are very awesome
you will find a lot of food shops on the main road of hawa mahal
and you can also do shopping from here
the more beautiful the hawa mahal looks during the day the more it looks dazzling at night so you must visit it at night too
after hawa mahal you can visit jantarmantar
which is located at a walking distance of half kilometer
the ticket here is inr 50 and the entry timing is 9 am to 5 pm
this jantarmantar is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments
which was built by raja sawai jay singh in 1734
this jantar mantar also comes in the unesco world heritage site
there are five such jantar mantars in india which are located in delhi varanasi ujjain mathura and jaipur
but the special thing about jaipurs jantarmantar is that it is an outdoor observatory where all the instruments are in open space instead of an enclosed building or room
it is a stone observatory
metal shrinks and expands according to the season
and any climate does not impacts the stone
with the help of these instruments events like weather local time planets constellations and eclipses can be detected
as an example this instrument is the worlds largest sun clock
which calculates time up to an accuracy of two seconds
similarly you can find here more interesting different instruments
so if you are an astronomy or a science student then this is a must visit place because it is the only observatory where you can do practical calculations according to the sun
and even today it is in working condition and shows results exactly
that is why it is called jantarmantar
because jantar means yantra which means instrument and mantar means calculation so jantarmantar means calculation instrument
friendsi will recommend if you want to understand all these instruments
well then you must hire a guide here to help you understand better
and here is an audio visual hall where detailed information is provided about jantarmantra which is free of cost
tipvisit jantar mantar in the afternoon time because then the sun is vertically above us so that you can understand the instrument interpretation better
exactly in front of jantar mantar is the city palace whose ticket is inr 200
city palace was also built by maharaja sawai jai singh in 1727
this palace is a beautiful fusion of earlier mughal and rajput architecture where even today the ruling royal family lives in its private section
palace has mubarak mahal also known as the palace of reception
mubarak mahal has now been converted into a museum
where you can find royal costumes like pashmina shawls banaras silk sarees clothes of maharaja sawai madho singh and 15th century rajput weapons are also on display
city palace has diwaneaam known as sarvato bhadra it is that place where the maharaja used to hold public meetings
then comes the deewanekhas this is the royal court where where the maharaja used to hold private meetings with his court
the ceiling of the palace is decorated with beautiful paintings
here you can see two silver ganga jali with a capacity of 4000 liters whose place is in the guinness book of world records
it is said to have been used by maharaja sawai madho singh to carry holy water from the ganges during his visit to england
because he only used to drink ganga water
you can also hire a guide in the city palace and it will take you 2 hours comfortably to visit the entire palace
whatever you say you will definitely be mesmerized by the beauty of city palace

but if you drink a little more iconic coffee if you can go to indian coffee house there is an old indian chain and their cold coffee is very good along with it indian coffee house also from the rest of his outlets apart from tea coffee you are very different you can also try this lassi and lassi meets lassi here jalmahal ice cream is jaipur in front of wala one of the old ice cream shops and here ice cream of different flavors you find dejerts like no day shakes if you go from all these fancy ice cream if you like more simple kulfi you go to pandit kulfi or ramchandra kulfi both of these can also be local are favorite and old here even today they make kulfi with technology find different flavors like cream pistachios if you will go to cax cookies mafins all this if you like to try then you kushal bakery can go the first here one of the bakeries and here all these sweets as well as mini pizza rolls if you get things like you going to description of all these places if you see locations you will feel brother jaipur i run here and there to fill my stomach one has to walk by doing this but not like this we have a solution for this chalk mahavir rabri bhandar gopal singh passhi stores gulab ji tea all these outlets you also get it in masala chalk because of the chaat here and the plates here all this from hot jalebi to kulfi rabri if you want to eat in the same place then the masala go to chowk is the entry fee to come here about â‚¹ 10 and the best thing is albert if it is very close to the museum then roam there then you can come here and eat now i told you all the affordable places now come a few caffees and on restaurants the price of a little it is more
but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences
if you are here it is very big here famous cafes and tea coffee snacks here things like maggi are available but by eating more people chilling here and brilliant sunset the views come to see the view another place to place is unique cafe here cax vegan dishes sandwich burgers salads it is good that things are found if you are next to the unique store before shopping or after shopping here can enjoy food comfortably wind is among jaipurs most famous caffeces view cafe and tattoo cafe and hawa mahal are in front of it but by eating his view is more famous here often we have to do waiting
but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes
all you can enjoy i recommend will do their cheese green chili for every order along with this there is also a papad platter from which to eat the fun increases further to eat full miles here the price may be higher but a fort it is an experience to come inside in glory and you can take royal experience that is jai mahal palace i stayed in this palace was and that experience i share with you before i have done it if you have not seen it after the video is over they must watch this there are two restaurants in the palace hai jordan hose is an authentic italian restaurant is here pizza pasta risot as you get all the italian dishes the atmosphere is very beautiful of pool and palace enjoy eating comfortably with the view something else but many people in jaipur only traditional rajasthani culture jaymahal wants to experience them palaces cinemation is not all in this hotel pierce glasses spoon plates are all gold its atmosphere with them is also great large archus energy long tables colorful windows look so royal and there are some private dining areas here where you eat comfortably sitting on donkeys down can enjoy before your order papad platter comes and here is their vegetarian plate in different dishes in it meet
and so many local specialty such as dal bati churma ker sangri yeh there is a very cool trio experience is probably the most spectacular will experience in hotels in jaipur and that is its names in suvarna mahal restaurant it is everywhere from carpet to sealing but golden feel is all the golden feel there is also a layer of 18 carat gold on utensils here you can try their vegetarian plate in it all items are served in a very royal style and the style of serving their taste and this is complete the royal atmosphere and their wonderful sake because of this it seems exactly the rambagh there is another restaurant in steam this one the old train is like a coach and there is also a restore steam engine really here you have many different types of different types continental dishes that you relax both of them can enjoy sitting with restaurants are part of rambagh palace but also open for outside visitors rambagh palace remains the most of india one of expensive hotels and i have experienced luxurious stay and recently i have also shared her link with you if below is given in the description box you are planning a luxury trip in jaipur if you are rambagh palace or jai mahal palace surely keep in mind
yes on them night charges can be between 30 and 60000 so they must keep in mind but both of them there are also 200 years old palace where one rajput family and ministers really in the era used to live because of that you have a restless place i get experience of living in rooms is another such luxury property trident jaipur this water palace right in front of and in many rooms here mansarovar lake and beautiful view of jal mahal palace appears it is a little different from those palaces and in this you have a little modern style eye if you enjoy the pool buffet plate here can but if you are right in a different way if you book on time you also in 78000 you can find living in this luxury property apart from these luxury hotels many here separate hotels are the price of mid range hotels 4 from 8000 from the fun lemon tree you will find a hotel like abis here if you book in advance then just 34000 i can also talk
but yes the season on time this price increases the season ie here in these months between november to march very pleasant weather remains light sunlight in the morning and in the evening cold air for such a trip cotton clothes are right
but at night you shawl or jacket is needed jaipur is the capital of rajasthan and india one of the most famous cities of is here but the tourist arrival is also very much and that it is very easy to reach here due to india direct flights come here from many cities delhi to jaipur is close â‚¹ 2500000 if you book in advance you such prices can be available for one and a half hours how many miles cross
but if you have time then you train you can save some money from mumbai many such trains from jaipur delhi to jaipur will be found and at â‚¹ 600 according to the coach the seat starts and 1617 it takes this hour to delhi jaipur famous of india and india is also associated with tourist circuit also in golden triangle if you are included from delhi or agra to road you can easily come here for this buses and private taxis are also available which leaves you jaipur in 2 3000 la is the best to come to jaipur and you and if there is short distance then you also from erickshaw it can go in sharing and just you take a seat at 40 you sometimes can also do bargain

albert hall museum,albert hall museum,Saturday Shooters,7cPLbiblb84,0,"lo to explore jaipur
so i hired an auto which cost me for inr 1500 per day
on day 1 you can explore albert hall museum friendsfor most of tourist attractions one need to buy ticket
so my recommendation is to buy a composite ticket which costs inr 400 for indians and inr 1000 for foreigners
this ticket is valid for 2 days
in which you can visit 7 to 8 points
so that you do not need to buy tickets at every point and hence can save your time
albert hall museum is the oldest museum of jaipur
building was designed by samuel jacob
and in 1887 it was opened for public visit
this museum is named after king albert edward vii
in this museum you can see these beautiful paintings on the walls pottery objects sculptures stone work woodwork jewelry carpets and can see precious artifacts from all over the world
the museum is a true representation of indosaracenic style of architecture and design
surprisingly this museum also has a 2400yearold egyptian mummy
whose name used to be tutu
each part of the museum gives a different glimpse of a time
when we did not have the machines to carve such a huge structure
beautiful artifacts paintings and designs of this museum is a treat for the gazing eyes
this museum looks even more beautiful in the night
which you can also visit between 7 pm to 10 pm in the night
just 1 km away from albert hall museum you can explore sargasuli tower
it is entry is from back road it is also known as isarlat sargasuli
people call it as tower of heaven
it was built in 1749 by raja ishwari singh after his victory over raja madhav singh
this sevenstoried tower is known for its circular steps
there is a door on each floor that opens to a balcony
there are 264 steps in total

this skykissing tower is a symbol of jaipurs victory
a symbol of pride and glory because of its height beauty and glorious history this building fills the people of jaipur with inspiration and pride
and this tower looks amazing when seen at night
just one minute away from sargasuli tower you can visit hawa mahal
the most recognisable landmark in jaipur is hawa mahal
also known as palace of winds
the entry of the hawa mahal is from the side road
timings are 9 am to 530 pm and tickets are as per screen hawa mahal was built by maharaja sawai pratap singh in 1799
which was designed by ustad lalchand
it is made up of red and pink sandstone
do you know hawa mahal is the tallest building in the world
which is built without any foundation
and people from all over the world like to click their photos in front of it
the design of hawa mahal is a perfect blend of islamic mughal architecture with hindu rajput architecture
this palace is made in the shape of a crown
some people also compare this form with the crown of lord shri krishna
because maharaja sawai pratap singh was a great devotee of lord shri krishna
the hawa mahal has a temple on each of its five floors
sharad temple on the first floor ratan temple on the second then the vichitra temple prakash temple and hawa temple
the hawa mahal has a total of 953 windows
and you will be surprised to know that there are no stairs in this fivestorey building
ramps have been made here because it was easy to carry the palanquin of rajput royal women from the ramp
in those days purdah system was strictly followed and royal rajput women were not allowed to show their face to strangers that is why maharaja built the hawa mahal
so that these royal women could see daytoday activities of the street and festivals through these windows without coming in front of anyone
friends believe it or not the beautiful view of hawa mahal is visible only from its outside
you can also cross the road and visit cafes and restaurants in front of the hawa mahal you can reach on the terrace and can see the hawa mahal
clicks of hawa mahal from here are very awesome
you will find a lot of food shops on the main road of hawa mahal
and you can also do shopping from here
the more beautiful the hawa mahal looks during the day the more it looks dazzling at night so you must visit it at night too
after hawa mahal you can visit jantarmantar
which is located at a walking distance of half kilometer
the ticket here is inr 50 and the entry timing is 9 am to 5 pm
this jantarmantar is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments
which was built by raja sawai jay singh in 1734
this jantar mantar also comes in the unesco world heritage site
there are five such jantar mantars in india which are located in delhi varanasi ujjain mathura and jaipur
but the special thing about jaipurs jantarmantar is that it is an outdoor observatory where all the instruments are in open space instead of an enclosed building or room
it is a stone observatory
metal shrinks and expands according to the season
and any climate does not impacts the stone
with the help of these instruments events like weather local time planets constellations and eclipses can be detected
as an example this instrument is the worlds largest sun clock
which calculates time up to an accuracy of two seconds
similarly you can find here more interesting different instruments
so if you are an astronomy or a science student then this is a must visit place because it is the only observatory where you can do practical calculations according to the sun
and even today it is in working condition and shows results exactly
that is why it is called jantarmantar
because jantar means yantra which means instrument and mantar means calculation so jantarmantar means calculation instrument
friendsi will recommend if you want to understand all these instruments
well then you must hire a guide here to help you understand better
and here is an audio visual hall where detailed information is provided about jantarmantra which is free of cost
tipvisit jantar mantar in the afternoon time because then the sun is vertically above us so that you can understand the instrument interpretation better
exactly in front of jantar mantar is the city palace whose ticket is inr 200
city palace was also built by maharaja sawai jai singh in 1727
this palace is a beautiful fusion of earlier mughal and rajput architecture where even today the ruling royal family lives in its private section
palace has mubarak mahal also known as the palace of reception
mubarak mahal has now been converted into a museum
where you can find royal costumes like pashmina shawls banaras silk sarees clothes of maharaja sawai madho singh and 15th century rajput weapons are also on display
city palace has diwaneaam known as sarvato bhadra it is that place where the maharaja used to hold public meetings
then comes the deewanekhas this is the royal court where where the maharaja used to hold private meetings with his court
the ceiling of the palace is decorated with beautiful paintings
here you can see two silver ganga jali with a capacity of 4000 liters whose place is in the guinness book of world records
it is said to have been used by maharaja sawai madho singh to carry holy water from the ganges during his visit to england
because he only used to drink ganga water

whatever you say you will definitely be mesmerized by the beauty of city palace

and so many local specialty such as dal bati churma ker sangri yeh there is a very cool trio experience is probably the most spectacular will experience in hotels in jaipur and that is its names in suvarna mahal restaurant it is everywhere from carpet to sealing but golden feel is all the golden feel there is also a layer of 18 carat gold on utensils here you can try their vegetarian plate in it all items are served in a very royal style and the style of serving their taste and this is complete the royal atmosphere and their wonderful sake because of this it seems exactly the rambagh there is another restaurant in steam this one the old train is like a coach and there is also a restore steam engine really here you have many different types of different types continental dishes that you relax both of them can enjoy sitting with restaurants are part of rambagh palace but also open for outside visitors rambagh palace remains the most of india one of expensive hotels and i have experienced luxurious stay and recently i have also shared her link with you if below is given in the description box you are planning a luxury trip in jaipur if you are rambagh palace or jai mahal palace surely keep in mind
yes on them night charges can be between 30 and 60000 so they must keep in mind but both of them there are also 200 years old palace where one rajput family and ministers really in the era used to live because of that you have a restless place i get experience of living in rooms is another such luxury property trident jaipur this water palace right in front of and in many rooms here mansarovar lake and beautiful view of jal mahal palace appears it is a little different from those palaces and in this you have a little modern style eye if you enjoy the pool buffet plate here can but if you are right in a different way if you book on time you also in 78000 you can find living in this luxury property apart from these luxury hotels many here separate hotels are the price of mid range hotels 4 from 8000 from the fun lemon tree you will find a hotel like abis here if you book in advance then just 34000 i can also talk
but yes the season on time this price increases the season ie here in these months between november to march very pleasant weather remains light sunlight in the morning and in the evening cold air for such a trip cotton clothes are right
but at night you shawl or jacket is needed jaipur is the capital of rajasthan and india one of the most famous cities of is here but the tourist arrival is also very much and that it is very easy to reach here due to india direct flights come here from many cities delhi to jaipur is close â‚¹ 2500000 if you book in advance you such prices can be available for one and a half hours how many miles cross
but if you have time then you train you can save some money from mumbai many such trains from jaipur delhi to jaipur will be found and at â‚¹ 600 according to the coach the seat starts and 1617 it takes this hour to delhi jaipur famous of india and india is also associated with tourist circuit also in golden triangle if you are included from delhi or agra to road you can easily come here for this buses and private taxis are also available which leaves you jaipur in 2 3000 la is the best to come to jaipur and you and if there is short distance then you also from erickshaw it can go in sharing and just you take a seat at 40 you sometimes can also do bargain

jantarmantar,jantarmantar,TheSocialTraveller,7cPLbiblb84,0,"he more it looks dazzling at night so you must visit it at night too
after hawa mahal you can visit jantarmantar
which is located at a walking distance of half kilometer
the ticket here is inr 50 and the entry timing is 9 am to 5 pm
this jantarmantar is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments
which was built by raja sawai jay singh in 1734
this jantar mantar also comes in the unesco world heritage site
there are five such jantar mantars in india which are located in delhi varanasi ujjain mathura and jaipur
but the special thing about jaipurs jantarmantar is that it is an outdoor observatory where all the instruments are in open space instead of an enclosed building or room
it is a stone observatory
metal shrinks and expands according to the season
and any climate does not impacts the stone
with the help of these instruments events like weather local time planets constellations and eclipses can be detected
as an example this instrument is the worlds largest sun clock
which calculates time up to an accuracy of two seconds
similarly you can find here more interesting different instruments
so if you are an astronomy or a science student then this is a must visit place because it is the only observatory where you can do practical calculations according to the sun
and even today it is in working condition and shows results exactly
that is why it is called jantarmantar
because jantar means yantra which means instrument and mantar means calculation so jantarmantar means calculation instrument

but if you drink a little more iconic coffee if you can go to indian coffee house there is an old indian chain and their cold coffee is very good along with it indian coffee house also from the rest of his outlets apart from tea coffee you are very different you can also try this lassi and lassi meets lassi here jalmahal ice cream is jaipur in front of wala one of the old ice cream shops and here ice cream of different flavors you find dejerts like no day shakes if you go from all these fancy ice cream if you like more simple kulfi you go to pandit kulfi or ramchandra kulfi both of these can also be local are favorite and old here even today they make kulfi with technology find different flavors like cream pistachios if you will go to cax cookies mafins all this if you like to try then you kushal bakery can go the first here one of the bakeries and here all these sweets as well as mini pizza rolls if you get things like you going to description of all these places if you see locations you will feel brother jaipur i run here and there to fill my stomach one has to walk by doing this but not like this we have a solution for this chalk mahavir rabri bhandar gopal singh passhi stores gulab ji tea all these outlets you also get it in masala chalk because of the chaat here and the plates here all this from hot jalebi to kulfi rabri if you want to eat in the same place then the masala go to chowk is the entry fee to come here about â‚¹ 10 and the best thing is albert if it is very close to the museum then roam there then you can come here and eat now i told you all the affordable places now come a few caffees and on restaurants the price of a little it is more
but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences
if you are here it is very big here famous cafes and tea coffee snacks here things like maggi are available but by eating more people chilling here and brilliant sunset the views come to see the view another place to place is unique cafe here cax vegan dishes sandwich burgers salads it is good that things are found if you are next to the unique store before shopping or after shopping here can enjoy food comfortably wind is among jaipurs most famous caffeces view cafe and tattoo cafe and hawa mahal are in front of it but by eating his view is more famous here often we have to do waiting
but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes

but if you drink a little more iconic coffee if you can go to indian coffee house there is an old indian chain and their cold coffee is very good along with it indian coffee house also from the rest of his outlets apart from tea coffee you are very different you can also try this lassi and lassi meets lassi here jalmahal ice cream is jaipur in front of wala one of the old ice cream shops and here ice cream of different flavors you find dejerts like no day shakes if you go from all these fancy ice cream if you like more simple kulfi you go to pandit kulfi or ramchandra kulfi both of these can also be local are favorite and old here even today they make kulfi with technology find different flavors like cream pistachios if you will go to cax cookies mafins all this if you like to try then you kushal bakery can go the first here one of the bakeries and here all these sweets as well as mini pizza rolls if you get things like you going to description of all these places if you see locations you will feel brother jaipur i run here and there to fill my stomach one has to walk by doing this but not like this we have a solution for this chalk mahavir rabri bhandar gopal singh passhi stores gulab ji tea all these outlets you also get it in masala chalk because of the chaat here and the plates here all this from hot jalebi to kulfi rabri if you want to eat in the same place then the masala go to chowk is the entry fee to come here about â‚¹ 10 and the best thing is albert if it is very close to the museum then roam there then you can come here and eat now i told you all the affordable places now come a few caffees and on restaurants the price of a little it is more
but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences
if you are here it is very big here famous cafes and tea coffee snacks here things like maggi are available but by eating more people chilling here and brilliant sunset the views come to see the view another place to place is unique cafe here cax vegan dishes sandwich burgers salads it is good that things are found if you are next to the unique store before shopping or after shopping here can enjoy food comfortably wind is among jaipurs most famous caffeces view cafe and tattoo cafe and hawa mahal are in front of it but by eating his view is more famous here often we have to do waiting
but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes
all you can enjoy i recommend will do their cheese green chili for every order along with this there is also a papad platter from which to eat the fun increases further to eat full miles here the price may be higher but a fort it is an experience to come inside in glory and you can take royal experience that is jai mahal palace i stayed in this palace was and that experience i share with you before i have done it if you have not seen it after the video is over they must watch this there are two restaurants in the palace hai jordan hose is an authentic italian restaurant is here pizza pasta risot as you get all the italian dishes the atmosphere is very beautiful of pool and palace enjoy eating comfortably with the view something else but many people in jaipur only traditional rajasthani culture jaymahal wants to experience them palaces cinemation is not all in this hotel pierce glasses spoon plates are all gold its atmosphere with them is also great large archus energy long tables colorful windows look so royal and there are some private dining areas here where you eat comfortably sitting on donkeys down can enjoy before your order papad platter comes and here is their vegetarian plate in different dishes in it meet
and so many local specialty such as dal bati churma ker sangri yeh there is a very cool trio experience is probably the most spectacular will experience in hotels in jaipur and that is its names in suvarna mahal restaurant it is everywhere from carpet to sealing but golden feel is all the golden feel there is also a layer of 18 carat gold on utensils here you can try their vegetarian plate in it all items are served in a very royal style and the style of serving their taste and this is complete the royal atmosphere and their wonderful sake because of this it seems exactly the rambagh there is another restaurant in steam this one the old train is like a coach and there is also a restore steam engine really here you have many different types of different types continental dishes that you relax both of them can enjoy sitting with restaurants are part of rambagh palace but also open for outside visitors rambagh palace remains the most of india one of expensive hotels and i have experienced luxurious stay and recently i have also shared her link with you if below is given in the description box you are planning a luxury trip in jaipur if you are rambagh palace or jai mahal palace surely keep in mind
yes on them night charges can be between 30 and 60000 so they must keep in mind but both of them there are also 200 years old palace where one rajput family and ministers really in the era used to live because of that you have a restless place i get experience of living in rooms is another such luxury property trident jaipur this water palace right in front of and in many rooms here mansarovar lake and beautiful view of jal mahal palace appears it is a little different from those palaces and in this you have a little modern style eye if you enjoy the pool buffet plate here can but if you are right in a different way if you book on time you also in 78000 you can find living in this luxury property apart from these luxury hotels many here separate hotels are the price of mid range hotels 4 from 8000 from the fun lemon tree you will find a hotel like abis here if you book in advance then just 34000 i can also talk
but yes the season on time this price increases the season ie here in these months between november to march very pleasant weather remains light sunlight in the morning and in the evening cold air for such a trip cotton clothes are right
but at night you shawl or jacket is needed jaipur is the capital of rajasthan and india one of the most famous cities of is here but the tourist arrival is also very much and that it is very easy to reach here due to india direct flights come here from many cities delhi to jaipur is close â‚¹ 2500000 if you book in advance you such prices can be available for one and a half hours how many miles cross
but if you have time then you train you can save some money from mumbai many such trains from jaipur delhi to jaipur will be found and at â‚¹ 600 according to the coach the seat starts and 1617 it takes this hour to delhi jaipur famous of india and india is also associated with tourist circuit also in golden triangle if you are included from delhi or agra to road you can easily come here for this buses and private taxis are also available which leaves you jaipur in 2 3000 la is the best to come to jaipur and you and if there is short distance then you also from erickshaw it can go in sharing and just you take a seat at 40 you sometimes can also do bargain

but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences
if you are here it is very big here famous cafes and tea coffee snacks here things like maggi are available but by eating more people chilling here and brilliant sunset the views come to see the view another place to place is unique cafe here cax vegan dishes sandwich burgers salads it is good that things are found if you are next to the unique store before shopping or after shopping here can enjoy food comfortably wind is among jaipurs most famous caffeces view cafe and tattoo cafe and hawa mahal are in front of it but by eating his view is more famous here often we have to do waiting
but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes
all you can enjoy i recommend will do their cheese green chili for every order along with this there is also a papad platter from which to eat the fun increases further to eat full miles here the price may be higher but a fort it is an experience to come inside in glory and you can take royal experience that is jai mahal palace i stayed in this palace was and that experience i share with you before i have done it if you have not seen it after the video is over they must watch this there are two restaurants in the palace hai jordan hose is an authentic italian restaurant is here pizza pasta risot as you get all the italian dishes the atmosphere is very beautiful of pool and palace enjoy eating comfortably with the view something else but many people in jaipur only traditional rajasthani culture jaymahal wants to experience them palaces cinemation is not all in this hotel pierce glasses spoon plates are all gold its atmosphere with them is also great large archus energy long tables colorful windows look so royal and there are some private dining areas here where you eat comfortably sitting on donkeys down can enjoy before your order papad platter comes and here is their vegetarian plate in different dishes in it meet
and so many local specialty such as dal bati churma ker sangri yeh there is a very cool trio experience is probably the most spectacular will experience in hotels in jaipur and that is its names in suvarna mahal restaurant it is everywhere from carpet to sealing but golden feel is all the golden feel there is also a layer of 18 carat gold on utensils here you can try their vegetarian plate in it all items are served in a very royal style and the style of serving their taste and this is complete the royal atmosphere and their wonderful sake because of this it seems exactly the rambagh there is another restaurant in steam this one the old train is like a coach and there is also a restore steam engine really here you have many different types of different types continental dishes that you relax both of them can enjoy sitting with restaurants are part of rambagh palace but also open for outside visitors rambagh palace remains the most of india one of expensive hotels and i have experienced luxurious stay and recently i have also shared her link with you if below is given in the description box you are planning a luxury trip in jaipur if you are rambagh palace or jai mahal palace surely keep in mind
yes on them night charges can be between 30 and 60000 so they must keep in mind but both of them there are also 200 years old palace where one rajput family and ministers really in the era used to live because of that you have a restless place i get experience of living in rooms is another such luxury property trident jaipur this water palace right in front of and in many rooms here mansarovar lake and beautiful view of jal mahal palace appears it is a little different from those palaces and in this you have a little modern style eye if you enjoy the pool buffet plate here can but if you are right in a different way if you book on time you also in 78000 you can find living in this luxury property apart from these luxury hotels many here separate hotels are the price of mid range hotels 4 from 8000 from the fun lemon tree you will find a hotel like abis here if you book in advance then just 34000 i can also talk
but yes the season on time this price increases the season ie here in these months between november to march very pleasant weather remains light sunlight in the morning and in the evening cold air for such a trip cotton clothes are right
but at night you shawl or jacket is needed jaipur is the capital of rajasthan and india one of the most famous cities of is here but the tourist arrival is also very much and that it is very easy to reach here due to india direct flights come here from many cities delhi to jaipur is close â‚¹ 2500000 if you book in advance you such prices can be available for one and a half hours how many miles cross
but if you have time then you train you can save some money from mumbai many such trains from jaipur delhi to jaipur will be found and at â‚¹ 600 according to the coach the seat starts and 1617 it takes this hour to delhi jaipur famous of india and india is also associated with tourist circuit also in golden triangle if you are included from delhi or agra to road you can easily come here for this buses and private taxis are also available which leaves you jaipur in 2 3000 la is the best to come to jaipur and you and if there is short distance then you also from erickshaw it can go in sharing and just you take a seat at 40 you sometimes can also do bargain

but if you drink a little more iconic coffee if you can go to indian coffee house there is an old indian chain and their cold coffee is very good along with it indian coffee house also from the rest of his outlets apart from tea coffee you are very different you can also try this lassi and lassi meets lassi here jalmahal ice cream is jaipur in front of wala one of the old ice cream shops and here ice cream of different flavors you find dejerts like no day shakes if you go from all these fancy ice cream if you like more simple kulfi you go to pandit kulfi or ramchandra kulfi both of these can also be local are favorite and old here even today they make kulfi with technology find different flavors like cream pistachios if you will go to cax cookies mafins all this if you like to try then you kushal bakery can go the first here one of the bakeries and here all these sweets as well as mini pizza rolls if you get things like you going to description of all these places if you see locations you will feel brother jaipur i run here and there to fill my stomach one has to walk by doing this but not like this we have a solution for this chalk mahavir rabri bhandar gopal singh passhi stores gulab ji tea all these outlets you also get it in masala chalk because of the chaat here and the plates here all this from hot jalebi to kulfi rabri if you want to eat in the same place then the masala go to chowk is the entry fee to come here about â‚¹ 10 and the best thing is albert if it is very close to the museum then roam there then you can come here and eat now i told you all the affordable places now come a few caffees and on restaurants the price of a little it is more
but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences
if you are here it is very big here famous cafes and tea coffee snacks here things like maggi are available but by eating more people chilling here and brilliant sunset the views come to see the view another place to place is unique cafe here cax vegan dishes sandwich burgers salads it is good that things are found if you are next to the unique store before shopping or after shopping here can enjoy food comfortably wind is among jaipurs most famous caffeces view cafe and tattoo cafe and hawa mahal are in front of it but by eating his view is more famous here often we have to do waiting
but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes

the most acquaintances and landmarks here are restaurant is l mb ie lakshmi mishtan bhandar this is famous here since 1727 there is confectioner and their big shop here today is and restaurants are also different sweets ghevar bhujia and chaat tikki curd with him you will get things like vadas if you want to eat comfortably then their l mb can also go to restaurant there is another famous shop nearby this is the emperor and his onion kachori potato kachori chilli big and samosas are very famous the place is rawat mixing store here too ghevar sweets gulab jamun malpua dyses are found their specialty is kachori and mirchi
b bada is now potato everywhere in jaipur and onion kachori is available but their the sugar syrup is also found nearby another shop for sweet is immersed in sodney sweets are special here bengali sweets their rasgulla barfi motichur laddus are very good here also found salty like kachori and samosas but here this is their lassi bhagat mishthan bhandar which has been here since 1957 and their desi ghee gram flour laddus and motichur laddu is the best if you like this kachori and mirchi try try if you want to do then you can go to saras the local dairy brand here and their milk ice cream as well as samosas in outlet cheese pakoras and jalebis are also found their taste is different and it is very all these previous shops are economical samosas are found but that love in them this is not a matter of light of light cinema is inside and their samosas are complete there is another special place in jaipur sanjay omelet is probably 3040 years old is a shop and first it is a small hand used to do it and now it is a great restaurant has become all kinds here omelets get simple sunny side up boiled maggi omelette shejwan omelette with eggs all you meet here will go if something lighter in low price if you want to eat then at the place of chaat here potato can go best for tikki chaat rahul chaat gives potato tikki in this two are and it is a very hot chaat nand for sev puri and curd puri here there is also chaat here pathsi says and gets good address gopal singh in patasi bhandar here flavor in durgadas chaat bhandar foundation is found and puffed garlic countless flavors like chilli if you are a tea or coffee lover then your there are two or three good places here sahu tea is near the emperor and his drinking good ginger tea would have fun there is another famous tea shop in jaipur gulab ji chai wali is always crowded here is and hard tea as well as masca pav also gets for coffee fans statue circle is the best place because cold coffee cold coffee with such with ice cream or chocolate chips variety gets cafes coffee in jaipur there are places like day starbucks
but if you drink a little more iconic coffee if you can go to indian coffee house there is an old indian chain and their cold coffee is very good along with it indian coffee house also from the rest of his outlets apart from tea coffee you are very different you can also try this lassi and lassi meets lassi here jalmahal ice cream is jaipur in front of wala one of the old ice cream shops and here ice cream of different flavors you find dejerts like no day shakes if you go from all these fancy ice cream if you like more simple kulfi you go to pandit kulfi or ramchandra kulfi both of these can also be local are favorite and old here even today they make kulfi with technology find different flavors like cream pistachios if you will go to cax cookies mafins all this if you like to try then you kushal bakery can go the first here one of the bakeries and here all these sweets as well as mini pizza rolls if you get things like you going to description of all these places if you see locations you will feel brother jaipur i run here and there to fill my stomach one has to walk by doing this but not like this we have a solution for this chalk mahavir rabri bhandar gopal singh passhi stores gulab ji tea all these outlets you also get it in masala chalk because of the chaat here and the plates here all this from hot jalebi to kulfi rabri if you want to eat in the same place then the masala go to chowk is the entry fee to come here about â‚¹ 10 and the best thing is albert if it is very close to the museum then roam there then you can come here and eat now i told you all the affordable places now come a few caffees and on restaurants the price of a little it is more
but it is with stomach worship giving some memorable experiences
if you are here it is very big here famous cafes and tea coffee snacks here things like maggi are available but by eating more people chilling here and brilliant sunset the views come to see the view another place to place is unique cafe here cax vegan dishes sandwich burgers salads it is good that things are found if you are next to the unique store before shopping or after shopping here can enjoy food comfortably wind is among jaipurs most famous caffeces view cafe and tattoo cafe and hawa mahal are in front of it but by eating his view is more famous here often we have to do waiting
but still it it is absolutely worth it because the wind from here the beautiful view of the palace is visible and this is also the best for photos with hawa mahal i think all the caffeces of jaipur according to me do give some unique experience
but if you want to focus on just eating if you are here niroj is here for 6070 years here and rajasthani specialty is here like red mask tandoori food vegetables asian food will all get good qualitys non vegetarian such as red this place is famous for mass and your butter cheese their price is a little more
but they gives you full fine dining experience is another restaurant by the name of my kitchen
so it seems to be an asian restaurant
but here you get everything asian continental and a little indian also this place the ambition is very pleasant in the cold it would be fun to sit in outdoor seating there are many more restaurants with such ambines here are one of these times so exactly the image residence of city palace beautifulbeautiful chandelier is a big bar blue and the design of white colors is all this place this is a multi kujan restaurant
but more than eating in its environment it is more fun and how much it is at night looks beautiful to chill at night and town saint also good place to spend time it has a lot of floors and here most people enjoy drinks and food come to i will recommend here their dances put a lot of topping on these jaipur night with live the fun of this food is different sitting in the view now if these restaurants will eat them the atmosphere and price is good according to all three stop if you look more than this here are some restaurants where food find a new memorable experience as well as a new memorable experience goes one of these posts dhani is a traditional rajasthani village like is a cot to sit on the ground and here such an atmosphere like a village is its clubia dance and ride together entertaining things like boat walks too here is in this entire area to do vaishnav devi temple ganga ghat amer there are also small sets of soil watching utensils not to see lacquer bangles wooden toys all this in their art village may be indian in an area here of different houses of states and their culture experience is found here you can take all the photos by doing all this do not know how the evening passes but after this it is real fun and that is their plate is delicious rajasthani food here get and this is their unlimited plate the style of serving is very unique if you want to know how i liked this plate given in the desire description box below you can see my full experience on the link the entry of this place is about 800 900 per capita and this plate in it it is included and many activities too but horses ride elephant ride all these things have to pay separate money and this one activities are in activity on some
20 let us go a similar traditional rajasthani experience but to take a little royal style there are more restaurants here the place is 1135 ad this is inside amer fort and sitting in that fort here large dining comes halls in those paintings and this chandelier how much royal feel comes here there is also private dining and here it is pride and it also increases and there is also outdoor seeding their glass and cutlery are full silver indian food food here containntal dishes
all you can enjoy i recommend will do their cheese green chili for every order along with this there is also a papad platter from which to eat the fun increases further to eat full miles here the price may be higher but a fort it is an experience to come inside in glory and you can take royal experience that is jai mahal palace i stayed in this palace was and that experience i share with you before i have done it if you have not seen it after the video is over they must watch this there are two restaurants in the palace hai jordan hose is an authentic italian restaurant is here pizza pasta risot as you get all the italian dishes the atmosphere is very beautiful of pool and palace enjoy eating comfortably with the view something else but many people in jaipur only traditional rajasthani culture jaymahal wants to experience them palaces cinemation is not all in this hotel pierce glasses spoon plates are all gold its atmosphere with them is also great large archus energy long tables colorful windows look so royal and there are some private dining areas here where you eat comfortably sitting on donkeys down can enjoy before your order papad platter comes and here is their vegetarian plate in different dishes in it meet
and so many local specialty such as dal bati churma ker sangri yeh there is a very cool trio experience is probably the most spectacular will experience in hotels in jaipur and that is its names in suvarna mahal restaurant it is everywhere from carpet to sealing but golden feel is all the golden feel there is also a layer of 18 carat gold on utensils here you can try their vegetarian plate in it all items are served in a very royal style and the style of serving their taste and this is complete the royal atmosphere and their wonderful sake because of this it seems exactly the rambagh there is another restaurant in steam this one the old train is like a coach and there is also a restore steam engine really here you have many different types of different types continental dishes that you relax both of them can enjoy sitting with restaurants are part of rambagh palace but also open for outside visitors rambagh palace remains the most of india one of expensive hotels and i have experienced luxurious stay and recently i have also shared her link with you if below is given in the description box you are planning a luxury trip in jaipur if you are rambagh palace or jai mahal palace surely keep in mind

yes on them night charges can be between 30 and 60000 so they must keep in mind but both of them there are also 200 years old palace where one rajput family and ministers really in the era used to live because of that you have a restless place i get experience of living in rooms is another such luxury property trident jaipur this water palace right in front of and in many rooms here mansarovar lake and beautiful view of jal mahal palace appears it is a little different from those palaces and in this you have a little modern style eye if you enjoy the pool buffet plate here can but if you are right in a different way if you book on time you also in 78000 you can find living in this luxury property apart from these luxury hotels many here separate hotels are the price of mid range hotels 4 from 8000 from the fun lemon tree you will find a hotel like abis here if you book in advance then just 34000 i can also talk
but yes the season on time this price increases the season ie here in these months between november to march very pleasant weather remains light sunlight in the morning and in the evening cold air for such a trip cotton clothes are right
but at night you shawl or jacket is needed jaipur is the capital of rajasthan and india one of the most famous cities of is here but the tourist arrival is also very much and that it is very easy to reach here due to india direct flights come here from many cities delhi to jaipur is close â‚¹ 2500000 if you book in advance you such prices can be available for one and a half hours how many miles cross
but if you have time then you train you can save some money from mumbai many such trains from jaipur delhi to jaipur will be found and at â‚¹ 600 according to the coach the seat starts and 1617 it takes this hour to delhi jaipur famous of india and india is also associated with tourist circuit also in golden triangle if you are included from delhi or agra to road you can easily come here for this buses and private taxis are also available which leaves you jaipur in 2 3000 la is the best to come to jaipur and you and if there is short distance then you also from erickshaw it can go in sharing and just you take a seat at 40 you sometimes can also do bargain
there are three to four to visit jaipur the day is enough one day city palace hawa mahal for jantar mantar and neighborhood shopping second day to visit a fort like amer jaigarh third day albert hall and masala chowk and in the evening to enjoy the place like the outpost similar for shopping and fourth day for shopping from you cannot plan your confession i have to live and travel you all the options from budget to luxury tell you if you plan budget tour so in 35 40000 also talk is made but if a stay plan like jai mahal or rambagh let us assume 50 to 60000 extra

sun,sun,SugarSpiceNice India,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"stuffing i think it is a potato stuffing we will know one flavor that instantly hits you is that of sun is i think there is a lot of amchur in this and then hotness of the chili is there
but it is not crazy spicy and the flavor of the whole spices the flavor of hint this is absolutely mindblowing the outside covering is not overly thick
and it is not even crispy this in itself is extremely flavorful next thing
i am going to be trying is the kachori first of all just take a look at the texture of the kachori both the kachoris from out are super duper crunchy and also size like it is as big as my palm this one and this is probably slightly bigger let us break it
i think this is the dal wala kachori the filling inside feels like moong dal but the outer part of this kachori is everything like i could probably just scoop out the filling and just have this covering because it is that good now this is the super duper famous space katori onion kachori over here it is actually really really hot
i am not able to break a bigger piece but you can see the a bit of the stuffing here you can see the onion the potato
i can literally get the aroma of the onion i have had this so many times in jaipur but every time i am here i keep coming back for more it is that good
this is like a typical rajasthani breakfast
i mean if you are here you definitely got to enjoy this in this one the flavor of amchur is not that strong the flavor of onion kind of takes over having said that it is like such a vibrant taste it is difficult to put it down finally it is time for the mava kachori apparently all of your kachoris are fried in ghee and this one is topped with you can see the glaze on top and this is sticky goodness
so inside is a filling of mava i have never tasted this before and this is like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy b",stuff think potato stuffing know flavor instantly hit sun think lot amchur hotness chili crazy spicy flavor spice flavor hint absolutely mindblowe outside covering overly thick crispy extremely flavorful thing go try kachori look texture kachori kachoris super dup crunchy size like big palm probably slightly big let break think dal wala kachori filling inside feel like moong dal outer kachori like probably scoop filling covering good super duper famous space katori onion kachori actually hot able break big piece bit stuffing onion potato literally aroma onion time jaipur time come good like typical rajasthani breakfast mean definitely get enjoy flavor amchur strong flavor onion kind take having say like vibrant taste difficult finally time mava kachori apparently kachoris fry ghee top glaze sticky goodness inside filling mava taste like pleasant surprise mama inside lot flavor eliji powder elijah powder sweet think welcome add flavor tashani make overly sweet think crispy layer kachori kind take care wow bite think smile price piazz kachori rupee size exceptionally big moga kachori cost rupee slightly small pias katori mava kachori cost rupee dessert meter think fry ghee expensive mirchi bada cost rupee right place call neros think sound like broken record say favorite restaurant jaipur come place time probably jaipur trip try paneer butter masala like favorite paneer butter masala restaurant 1949 retain vintage feel especially famous mutton nonveg dish vegetarian tell thing disappoint paneer butter masala simple paneer gravy decadent flavorful paneer butter masala thing like chinese pretty chinese fry rice manchurian thing wrong narrow term pricing little bit high get quality food good taste go take original street right arrow point come lassiwala original 1944 shop number 312 like nice tall glass lassi kulhad little bit butter refreshing thing hot day jaipur lassi thing recommend cross road come jal mahal ice cream parlor think 1950 like flavor variety ice cream like sundaes giant chocolava sunday ready drop star look cute cake hot chocolate sauce chocolate ice cream waffle cone canopy sort wow sunny afternoon school sunday feel good finally get waffle ice cream good hand super messy go enjoy sunday place take guy place call sara popular dairy,8.330362857142857,AREA,0.18743497889581817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016548434505968438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2126480211827419,0.16341891764637143,0.05595248560784709,0.0,0.0,0.10538837898876931,0.1602003209839759,0.056786786518925846,0.0,0.21574334880686874,0.15471196762418027,0.1556542167000938,0.5568198818028584,0.05292672143446566,0.05364109484508285,0.5044336984982202,0.11190497121569418,0.10019459287891631,0.10019459287891631,0.04989545456128836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145858805335434,0.11357357303785169,0.0522371290378068,0.05413201495373177,0.0,0.0,0.29464785130062043,0.1972077608449012,0.10632401059137095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12893488072419404

then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of ",rupee slightly small pias katori mava kachori cost rupee dessert meter think fry ghee expensive mirchi bada cost rupee right place call neros think sound like broken record say favorite restaurant jaipur come place

and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try

samosa,samosa,Singhsman ,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"r ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews
so i told you they have the most interesting variety so that is the good samosa it is actually shaped like a samosa it is the pista so it is round like a bottle mango chocolate and this is again sesame seeds b",ghee shrikhand stuff like snack section actually paneer pakota samosa jalebi chai coffee lassi masala milk get plate paneer pakoda plate samosa outer pakora super duper crispy little bit chaat masala inside paneer need little bit chutney flavor paneer creamy spite crunch outer coat good personally like little bit ketchup okay chutney mixture meat samosa multiple time enjoy

onion,onion,Sakshi Yadav,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"and just have this covering because it is that good now this is the super duper famous space katori onion kachori over here it is actually really really hot
i am not able to break a bigger piece but you can see the a bit of the stuffing here you can see the onion the potato
i can literally get the aroma of the onion i have had this so many times in jaipur but every time i am here i keep coming back for more it is that good
this is like a typical rajasthani breakfast
i mean if you are here you definitely got to enjoy this in this one the flavor of amchur is not that strong the flavor of onion kind of takes over having said that it is like such a vibrant taste it is difficult to put it down finally it is time for the mava kachori apparently all of your kachoris are fried in ghee and this one is topped with you can see the glaze on top and this is sticky goodness
so inside is a filling of mava i have never tasted this before and this is like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different

ghee,ghee,Singhsman ,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"to put it down finally it is time for the mava kachori apparently all of your kachoris are fried in ghee and this one is topped with you can see the glaze on top and this is sticky goodness
so inside is a filling of mava i have never tasted this before and this is like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky

sweet,sweet,TheSocialTraveller,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"s like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews
so i told you they have the most interesting variety so that is the good samosa it is actually shaped like a samosa it is the pista so it is round like a bottle mango chocolate and this is again sesame seeds but a slightly different form in this too they have a lot of variety there is mango there is chocolate there is the one with sugar and there is the one with good
so this is my stock from naranji gajakwale i usually end up buying the ribery the good job and this time i also feel like trying the kaju katli gajak next stop is lmb
now i have shown this place to you guys so many times and it is just that good that every time i am in jaipur i make sure i visit this place at least two to three times you can find the link to my previous video from lmb in the description box below but some of the things that you really need to eat here are their aloo tiki chart and their dahi bada of course they are famous for their paneer gaver as well you can see the quantity of the dahiwada here there are four to five vadas and they are topped with some jeera powder and that is chili powder i think and that is the sweet chutney and finally filled it to the top with the heat i cannot wait to have this i am actuall",like pleasant surprise mama inside lot flavor eliji powder elijah powder sweet think welcome add flavor tashani make

mirchi bada,mirchi bada,SugarSpiceNice India,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"alties let us go inside and get some today i am starting with something different which is known as mirchi bada mirchi bada is a rajasthani specialty this is what it is it is essentially a mirchi pakoda and it is bada like it is huge
but i do not think bada stands for that bada is the way they pronounce vada and you have to look at it inside so inside is not just mirchi but like another layer like a thick thick layer of stuffing i think it is a potato stuffing we will know one flavor that instantly hits you is that of sun is i think there is a lot of amchur in this and then hotness of the chili is there
but it is not crazy spicy and the flavor of the whole spices the flavor of hint this is absolutely mindblowing the outside covering is not overly thick
and it is not even crispy this in itself is extremely flavorful next thing
i am going to be trying is the kachori first of all just take a look at the texture of the kachori both the kachoris from out are super duper crunchy and also size like it is as big as my palm this one and this is probably slightly bigger let us break it
i think this is the dal wala kachori the filling inside feels like moong dal but the outer part of this kachori is everything like i could probably just scoop out the filling and just have this covering because it is that good now this is the super duper famous space katori onion kachori over here it is actually really really hot
i am not able to break a bigger piece but you can see the a bit of the stuffing here you can see the onion the potato
i can literally get the aroma of the onion i have had this so many times in jaipur but every time i am here i keep coming back for more it is that good
this is like a typical rajasthani breakfast
i mean if you are here you definitely got to enjoy this in this one the flavor of amchur is not that strong the flavor of onion kind of takes over having said that it is like such a vibrant taste it is difficult to put it down finally it is time for the mava kachori apparently all of your kachoris are fried in ghee and this one is topped with you can see the glaze on top and this is sticky goodness
so inside is a filling of mava i have never tasted this before and this is like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori

kachori,kachori,Golgappa Girl,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"ndary jaipur food and not talk about especially the one at rawat now i have mostly tried their past kachori but from what i hear they have a lot of other local traditional specialties let us go inside and get some today i am starting with something different which is known as mirchi bada mirchi bada is a rajasthani specialty this is what it is it is essentially a mirchi pakoda and it is bada like it is huge
but i do not think bada stands for that bada is the way they pronounce vada and you have to look at it inside so inside is not just mirchi but like another layer like a thick thick layer of stuffing i think it is a potato stuffing we will know one flavor that instantly hits you is that of sun is i think there is a lot of amchur in this and then hotness of the chili is there
but it is not crazy spicy and the flavor of the whole spices the flavor of hint this is absolutely mindblowing the outside covering is not overly thick
and it is not even crispy this in itself is extremely flavorful next thing
i am going to be trying is the kachori first of all just take a look at the texture of the kachori both the kachoris from out are super duper crunchy and also size like it is as big as my palm this one and this is probably slightly bigger let us break it
i think this is the dal wala kachori the filling inside feels like moong dal but the outer part of this kachori is everything like i could probably just scoop out the filling and just have this covering because it is that good now this is the super duper famous space katori onion kachori over here it is actually really really hot
i am not able to break a bigger piece but you can see the a bit of the stuffing here you can see the onion the potato
i can literally get the aroma of the onion i have had this so many times in jaipur but every time i am here i keep coming back for more it is that good
this is like a typical rajasthani breakfast
i mean if you are here you definitely got to enjoy this in this one the flavor of amchur is not that strong the flavor of onion kind of takes over having said that it is like such a vibrant taste it is difficult to put it down finally it is time for the mava kachori apparently all of your kachoris are fried in ghee and this one is topped with you can see the glaze on top and this is sticky goodness
so inside is a filling of mava i have never tasted this before and this is like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different

it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews
so i told you they have the most interesting variety so that is the good samosa it is actually shaped like a samosa it is the pista so it is round like a bottle mango chocolate and this is again sesame seeds but a slightly different form in this too they have a lot of variety there is mango there is chocolate there is the one with sugar and there is the one with good
so this is my stock from naranji gajakwale i usually end up buying the ribery the good job and this time i also feel like trying the kaju katli gajak next stop is lmb
now i have shown this place to you guys so many times and it is just that good that every time i am in jaipur i make sure i visit this place at least two to three times you can find the link to my previous video from lmb in the description box below but some of the things that you really need to eat here are their aloo tiki chart and their dahi bada of course they are famous for their paneer gaver as well you can see the quantity of the dahiwada here there are four to five vadas and they are topped with some jeera powder and that is chili powder i think and that is the sweet chutney and finally filled it to the top with the heat i cannot wait to have this i am actually packing this for my family as well foreign like this one cooler will cost you 25 rupees it is a little bit steep for chai in my opinion but honestly it is completely worth it just because the quality of the chai and the taste of this chai is amazing
i personally do not enjoy chai which is not kadak not well boiled but this is done to perfection so here is to another amazing series in jaipur ah the most refreshing tea that i have had in jaipur is this one
i think he puts a little bit of masala a lot of eliji and the chai is kadak
but one thing is there for sure chai in a cooler it is different
so that is really it from me in this video from jaipur i hope you g",like snack section actually paneer pakota samosa jalebi chai coffee lassi masala milk get plate paneer pakoda plate samosa outer

masala,masala,SugarSpiceNice India,D1blpY-3ROE,0," to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews
so i told you they have the most interesting variety so that is the good samosa it is actually shaped like a samosa it is the pista so it is round like a bottle mango chocolate and this is again sesame seeds but a slightly different form in this too they have a lot of variety there is mango there is chocolate there is the one with sugar and there is the one with good
so this is my stock from naranji gajakwale i usually end up buying the ribery the good job and this time i also feel like trying the kaju katli gajak next stop is lmb
now i have shown this place to you guys so many times and it is just that good that every time i am in jaipur i make sure i visit this place at least two to three times you can find the link to my previous video from lmb in the description box below but some of the things that you really need to eat here are their aloo tiki chart and their dahi bada of course they are famous for their paneer gaver as well you can see the quantity of the dahiwada here there are four to five vadas and they are topped with some jeera powder and that is chili powder i think and that is the sweet chutney and finally filled it to the top with the heat i cannot wait to have this i am actually packing this for my family as well foreign like this one cooler will cost you 25 rupees it is a little bit steep for chai in my opinion but honestly it is completely worth it just because the quality of the chai and the taste of this chai is amazing
i personally do not enjoy chai which is not kadak not well boiled but this is done to perfection so here is to another amazing series in jaipur ah the most refreshing tea that i have had in jaipur is this one
i think he puts a little bit of masala a lot of eliji and the chai is kadak
but one thing is there for sure chai in a cooler it is d",place time probably jaipur trip try paneer butter masala like favorite paneer butter masala restaurant 1949 retain vintage feel especially

so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews
so i told you they have the most interesting variety so that is the good samosa it is actually shaped like a samosa it is the pista so it is round like a bottle mango chocolate and this is again sesame seeds but a slightly different form in this too they have a lot of variety there is mango there is chocolate there is the one with sugar and there is the one with good
so this is my stock from naranji gajakwale i usually end up buying the ribery the good job and this time i also feel like trying the kaju katli gajak next stop is lmb
now i have shown this place to you guys so many times and it is just that good that every time i am in jaipur i make sure i visit this place at least two to three times you can find the link to my previous video from lmb in the description box below but some of the things that you really need to eat here are their aloo tiki chart and their dahi bada of course they are famous for their paneer gaver as well you can see the quantity of the dahiwada here there are four to five vadas and they are topped with some jeera powder and that is chili powder i think and that is the sweet chutney and finally filled it to the top with the heat i cannot wait to have this i am actually packing this for my family as well foreign like this one cooler will cost you 25 rupees it is a little bit steep for chai in my opinion but honestly it is completely worth it just because the quality of the chai and the taste of this chai is amazing

well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews

i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind

top,topped,SugarSpiceNice India,D1blpY-3ROE,0,"y it is time for the mava kachori apparently all of your kachoris are fried in ghee and this one is topped with you can see the glaze on top and this is sticky goodness
so inside is a filling of mava i have never tasted this before and this is like a pleasant surprise the mama inside has a lot of flavor of eliji powder and elijah powder in sweets is i think always welcome it just adds to the flavor the tashani is not making it overly sweet
i think the crispy layer of the kachori is kind of taking care of that
but this is wow every bite i think i am smiling more the price of the piazz kachori is 45 rupees and for the size of it
it is exceptionally big the moga kachori cost 40 rupees it is slightly smaller than the pias katori the mava kachori costs 65 rupees this is the dessert the meter
and i think it is fried in ghee that is why it is the most expensive the mirchi bada cost 40 rupees so right now i am at a place called neros
i think i sound like a broken record when i am saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in jaipur but it is i came to this place first time probably on my first jaipur trip and ever since i tried the paneer butter masala here it was like my most favorite paneer butter masala ever this restaurant has been around since 1949
it still has retained that vintage feel it is especially famous for its mutton and other nonveg dishes but being a vegetarian i can tell you two things that will not disappoint you here one is their paneer butter masala it is a very simple paneer gravy but a very decadent one
it is one of the most flavorful paneer butter masalas that i have had the other thing that i like is they are chinese
it is pretty much they see chinese so fried rice and manchurian is another thing that you cannot go wrong with when it narrows in terms of pricing this is a little bit on the higher side
but you are getting quality food and good taste as well over there
but i am going to be taking you to the original one whenever you are in this street right after an arrows make it a point to come to lassiwala
so this here behind me is the original since 1944
it is shop number 312 and when you go here you get like a nice tall glass of lassi they give it in kulhad and they put a little bit of butter on top it is one of the most refreshing things that you can have on a hot day in jaipur if lassi is not your thing
then i recommend just crossing the road back again and coming to jal mahal ice cream parlor this is another one i think it is been around since sometime in 1950 or they have like their own flavors and variety of ice cream but what i like over here are their sundaes this is my giant chocolava sunday
ready
i have already dropped the star off but it looks so cute so there is cake there is hot chocolate sauce
and there is chocolate ice cream and all of this in a waffle cone canopy of sort this is
wow
it is a sunny afternoon so with that this school sunday is feeling really good finally got to the waffle part of the ice cream this is the best my hands are super messy which is goes to show that i have enjoyed this sunday next place that i am taking you guys to is a place called saras now this is a popular dairy brand of jaipur rajasthan and they actually have this outlet where they serve a few snacks and of course their ghee and shrikhand and stuff like that so in their snack section they actually have paneer pakota samosa jalebi and we also have chai coffee lassi masala milk
but i have got for myself one plate of the paneer pakoda and one plate of the samosa the outer part of the pakora is super duper crispy they top it with a little bit of chaat masala and inside is nothing but paneer need a little bit of chutney with it the flavor of paneer is everything in this
it is just so creamy in spite of all of that crunch that outer coating it still is good
i would personally like a little bit of ketchup with that but it is okay
there is chutney take a mixture of the meat i have had the samosa here multiple times and i quite enjoy it especially when it is like fresh piping hot right out of the kadai that is when it is most enjoyable the covering of the samosa is crunchy
goodness it is the perfect and even the masala inside very flavorful
it is got a little bit of mum paneer also which is a bit of a calcutta attached to the samosa but it is quite nice lots of whole spices whole dhania whole soft very tasty cannot come to saras and not have a plate of hot jalebi best part is this is 100 grams for 30 rupees and quite hot the color seems a little bit extra orange but the texture is amazing the taste is good and best part is it is not that extra thick chewy jalebi
it is nice and crunchy the best part about this place is that it is extremely value for money definitely try the softy as well over here chocolate or vanilla our topic
i think for me softly means vanilla this costs 15 rupees and you got to have it when you are here next place is called masala chalk now i have done a full video of this
and you guys can watch that on my channel but the one thing that i missed out in that video is exactly what i am going to be sharing in this video there is this one thali from a place called mahavir rabri and that place of course has been around for years but that thali has some of the most amazing rajasthani specialty so let us go inside and get one applause
a lot of traditional specialties in that one thali we have major roti which is a special roti which they eat over here which is made with ehu which is wheat it also has joa besan or gram flour and it is a really really massive size roti along with that there is lesson chutney there is mirchi ketepore which i had so enjoyed last time there is boondi raida and the traditional rajasthani style aloo pya sabzi and you can even add a rubbery in the thali now rabri is their specialty so you cannot not eat rabri from mahavir
so this is their kesari
the cost of everything in this thali is 180 rupees if you take it without the rubbery it is 130 rupees but i would recommend having the rabri here so now let me just start indulging in this this is probably one of the most flavorful alupiah stuff we have had in my entire life it is very very greasy
but so flavorful it is a spicy sabzi the flavor of onion is extremely prominent
and i simply love it as you can see there is like a big chunky piece of onion as well there are chunks of potato in it
it is seeming like fried potato which is what is making it even more tasty lot of red chilli a lot of fiery taste going to be trying the bone it is kind of like a chili pickle with a little bit of gram flour as well it is going to be fiery love it
i am going to be trying a little bit of that roti with the lesson chutney lesson chutney is a thing this is like a specialty in itself
it is literally just garlic and chilies but that flavor
and i also really am enjoying the roti it is feeling very very different than a regular roti obviously it even looks different it is thicker but all of the ghee has made it very flavorful a time at a place called sodani this is one of the most famous places amongst locals to buy sweets mithai there are so many different kinds of mithai it is not even funny burfi is bengali sweets and lot lot more one of my favorite over here is the rasgulla you have to see the size of their rasgulla it is massive and from inside it is just the perfect amount of spongy this rasgulla definitely makes me very very happy the savory snacks that you can find here include past kachori samosa bread pakoda paneer kofta and all of these are worth trying i have tried their bread pakoda again
so i buy it
i also like their samosa i leave the exact location in the description box below make sure you come to the right outlet bhagat has been around since 1957
this is one of those old places super duper famous for its mithai especially the ladoos that they have now i personally love their boondi ladoos i think these ones are besan killer let us just try and see they are not based on there are some other kind of ladoo i think they have a specific name to them if you know that let me know in the comments below but it is seeming like a mix of atta besan the good thing about bhagat is that their sweets are not like over meat tough and they are made in racy here
and i can definitely vouch for the quality now eating my favorite one from here the boondi ladoo these are one of the best bundila doos ever they are literally perfection each one is quite a chunky size the buni feels fresh the flavor of ghee is everything i think there is like a hint of elaichi as well and again they are not overly sweet
so i think bhagat definitely had to make it to my legendary list and if you guys are in jaipur definitely try the ladoos
so right now i am here at sanjay omelette earlier it used to be known as sanjay omelette but now it is known as egg d restaurant this place has been around for a really long time i have family members who are from jaipur and they have been coming here since they are bachpan so you can imagine how old that can be i do not eat omelette many places outside but this place is definitely an exception so this is my omelette choice at sanjay omelette
i know it is extremely basic
but i am not very experimental with my egg i usually come to this place for like nostalgia value green chutney with an omelette sandwich feels different
i am actually here with my friend
and she is ordered something really interesting looking egg masala maggie the omelette is covered with maggie you can see the noodles you can see the cheese like a proper masala omelette or masala
yeah i do not know
but there is masala tomato onion and everything in it
but it is also got that typical garlic chutney which is used very generously all through jaipur that is what i feel i think the whole flavor is really different really unique they actually have a lot of such unique items on their menu you will find egg chart then there is eggbased dessert then there is an egg pizza the cost of this egg masala maggie is 160 rupees and the cost of my omelette sandwich is 90 rupees so definitely sanjay omelette has come a long way i remember the first time i visited the place which was probably about eight years ago and at that time it was like this small stall people who have been in jaipur for longer they might have seen this place right since its humble beginning and now that it has a restaurant and an egg themed restaurant at that i think it is definitely come along with hi guys so right now i am at jawahar kala kendra and almost all the time there is some kind of an exhibition or a show or something on and a lot of these are like local handicrafts which you can come here and buy and you will also find a lot of lovely kurtas jewelry bags furniture blue pottery stuff little knickknacks which you can you know take back for your family and friends as a souvenir from jaipur i am going to take you guys around and i was actually just fascinated with all of the shops here so now that i am done looking around it is time to go to a place that has been around for a very very long time and it is actually a popular indian brand it is called indian coffee house
and i feel like this is the most well made and the most beautifully lit indian coffee house all of the others are kind of a little bit more on the darker side
but this one has a lot of natural light coming in in fact it is a very open airy space people are chilling and the overall theme of this place i think seems to have some sort of an astrological angle very artsy feel to it and three south indian food is what is famous
so you will see a lot of people having dosa italy
i actually just wanted a cup of coffee so that is exactly what i am having this is a cold coffee a plain simple cold coffee and they also do one with cream and ice cream
so if you are feeling a little bit more indulgent maybe you can try that inside jawahar kala kendra there is actually a lot of green space and you can come here take a walk
and i think it is a very nicely made place
so i think this is a good quick pit stop whenever you are coming to indian coffee house foreign gem
but definitely legendary in its own right it is called durga das chat bhandar
and they do seven or eight different types of pani this is jeera there was tamarind this one is cloves it is just coriander even their type of puris are different there is suji type with the long pushka style then there is atta and there is dal this is green chilli
i took it like after being tempted but i do not think i can eat this too spicy i could not have the green chili one
i just had the puri and my mouth is on fire i cannot deal with this
i mean i am going to be having something with dahi to tone this down lots of imli chutney lots of jeera powder the puris here also feel very very different
i think for me this experience is very very good
he is so patiently let me film here and thank you very much two plates of pani puri and one plate of dahi puri cost me 100 rupees and in my opinion it is completely worth it
i am going to leave the exact location in the description box below now the next place that i am taking you to is a place called samrat now this is famous in the chora rasta area for its samosa and kachori and this is one of the few places where i actually found an aloo kakachori this costs 20 rupees and it is served piping hot the flavor of hing in this is super duper strong and a few whole spices as well the outer texture is very different than our pyasa kachori this is nice apart from aloo ki kachori
you will also find here kachori mirchi bada and samosa these are the three famous items that i know of so you can definitely come and try
but i would highly recommend trying simply because it is something that i have not seen at many other places here in jaipur
and they do it really
well next stop is a place called narayanji gajafale this is a shop since 1953
it is very close to lmb and if you are fond of gajak which is usually like a winter specialty in the north then i highly recommend you come here and get some so let me just show you the different varieties of gajak available here so this is called tiruchakuri and this is where you can see the whole sesame seeds sugar made with sugar and with jaggery this one has been made with jaggery this is the standard gajab the kind
i love you can see the slight flakiness so in this everything has been powdered and assembled in ghee but in this you can see the whole sesame this is the one that i like this is peanut chicky over here whole peanut and good
i always thought chicky was a mumbai lonavla pune thing
but we are trying it in jaipur this is the softer version of the peanut chicken it will be much more chewy it is feeling like a healthy protein bar because you can literally get all peanut
and there is barely any sweetness in it
so they have the most interesting gaja combinations this one is
and i think it also has little bit of kaju and pista this one is feeling like it is made with sugar and nonjaggery even the color is slightly different that could also be because of the cashews
so i told you they have the most interesting variety so that is the good samosa it is actually shaped like a samosa it is the pista so it is round like a bottle mango chocolate and this is again sesame seeds but a slightly different form in this too they have a lot of variety there is mango there is chocolate there is the one with sugar and there is the one with good
so this is my stock from naranji gajakwale i usually end up buying the ribery the good job and this time i also feel like trying the kaju katli gajak next stop is lmb
now i have shown this place to you guys so many times and it is just that good that every time i am in jaipur i make sure i visit this place at least two to three times you can find the link to my previous video from lmb in the description box below but some of the things that you really need to eat here are their aloo tiki chart and their dahi bada of course they are famous for their paneer gaver as well you can see the quantity of the dahiwada here there are four to five vadas and they are topped with some jeera powder and that is chili powder i think and that is the sweet chutney and
